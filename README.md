## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

 	I am interested in this dataset because I have always wanted to visit Spain, specifically, Barcelona. Analyzing this dataset will act as research for when I am finally able to travel to Barcelona. I am hoping the analysis I do on this dataset will give me insight into popular areas in Spain, expected prices of staying in Barcelona at an Airbnb, and ratings so I can ensure I choose the best accommodations possible on my future trip. When choosing a dataset from Airbnb I notices there were many different countries I could choose from. However, I chose Barcelona not only because I want to travel there in the future, but also because I love the culture, music, and food. Through analyzing this dataset, I want to explore the best location to stay in Barcelona, as well as which properties have the highest ratings at the most affordable prices. I believe a user-facing Dashboard can be created with this dataset since there is a lot to be analyzed and discovered about the properties hosted on Airbnb which would be beneficial for the user to see on a dashboard as it would make understanding the data easier.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

	The dataset that I have chosen comes from the Airbnb websiteâ€™s database. The dataset contains data of property listings in Barcelona, Spain that are available for rent by people who wish to visit Barcelona. This data was last updated in December of 2020 and contains all listings that have been available up until that point. The data includes reviews of the property and owner, reviews, and pricing among several other pieces of information. The purpose of this dataset is to help people look at and analyze the properties being rented out in Barcelona so they can plan their accommodations accordingly. They can do this by using the dataset to look at the post popular properties, and the pricing. This dataset is most likely collected through server logs and digital databases as Airbnb is a website. In the end, this data set contains all the information regarding properties that can be rented out on the Airbnb site and well as the owners of the property, the location of it, pricing, etc.
